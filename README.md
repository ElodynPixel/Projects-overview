# Projects-overview
An overview of all projects I created.
********************************************************************
## [DNA transcribe to RNA](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/DNA-transcribe-to-RNA)

Python is used to transcribe a DNA sequence into RNA in a way similar to the natural occuring physiological transcription of DNA into RNA. All of this is done in less than five lines of code.

## [Nucleotides in DNA sequence](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/Nucleotides-in-DNA-sequences)

Using python the number of nucleotides can be counted and the base pair ratio can be calculated. This script can give information which can potentially be used to detect and diagnose mutations in a given DNA sequence.

## [Smart Health CHatbot Chronic Kidney Disease ](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/SmartHealthChatBot-Chronic_Kidney_Disease)

This chatbot can give you information about Chronic Kidney Disease: ~ Overview ~ Symptoms ~ What is Chronic kidney disease? ~ What is the treatment for chronic kidney disease? ~ When to see a doctor? ~ Causes ~ Risk factors and many more!

## [Smart Health CHatbot Diabetic Nephropathy](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/SmartHealthChatBot-Diabetic_Nephropathy)

This chatbot can give you information about DiabeticNeph: ~ Overview ~ Symptoms ~ When to see a doctor? ~ Causes ~ Risk factors and may more!

## [Smart Health Chatbot Epilepsy](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/SmartHealthChatBot-Epilepsy)

This chatbot can give you information about Epilepsy: ~ Overview ~ Symptoms ~ What is Focal seizures? ~ What is Generalized seizures? ~ When to see a doctor? ~ Causes ~ Risk factors and may more!

## [Calculating BMI](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/Calculating-BMI)

Python is used to calculate a persons BMI (Body Mass Index) and Categorizing the result according to severely overweight, overweight, healthy, underweight, and severely underweight.

## [Simple Neural Network](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/Simple-Neural-Network)

This simple neural network is created to predict one outcome from three different input values by applying mathematical equations and basing it on the naturally occuring physiological model of the inputs and outputs through a neuron by way of synapses.

## [Breast Cancer Detection AI](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/Breast_Cancer_Detection-AI)

For this project I used a breast cancer data set. It consists of many features describing a tumor and classifies them as either cancerous or non cancerous.

Similar to K Nearest Neighbors, SVMs are commonly used for classification tasks. They're great for high-dimensional data, and they let us classify data that doesn't have a linear relationship.

## [Over the moon](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/over-the-moon)

 

## [Looker Studio Project for Biotech](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/Looker-Studio-project-for-biotech)

I used world population data to visualize population trend in Countries and continents over the years. In this project I also learned how to join different table and the differnt configuration options for joining a table. In this example a Left outer join was used.


## [Sleep dashboard (Google sheets)](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/Sleep-dashboard-Google-sheets-) 

Building a dashboard on google sheets
I downloaded and imported Sleep efficiency data csv file and cleaned the data after removing empty cells and other formatting. 
The data was then sorted (for example age so it can appear in chronological order when used in charts). Charts created was to showcase the association between age and duration (bar chart) and a pie chart showcasing the proportion of yes and no answer to smoking status.
