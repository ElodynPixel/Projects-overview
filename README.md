# Projects-overview
An overview of all projects I created.
********************************************************************
## [DNA transcribe to RNA](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/DNA-transcribe-to-RNA)



## [Nucleotides in DNA sequence](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/Nucleotides-in-DNA-sequences)

Using python the number of nucleotides can be counted and the base pair ratio can be calculated. This script can give information which can potentially be used to detect and diagnose mutations in a given DNA sequence.

## [Smart Health CHatbot Chronic Kidney Disease ](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/SmartHealthChatBot-Chronic_Kidney_Disease)

Chronic Kidney Disease Chat-Bot
In this engaging project, I designed a specialized Chronic Kidney Disease Health Chatbot. Through the use of Python in a Jupyter Notebook and leveraging Numpy, I developed an intelligent conversational interface. Users could now access personalized information and support, enabling them to make informed decisions about their kidney health.


## [Smart Health CHatbot Diabetic Nephropathy](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/SmartHealthChatBot-Diabetic_Nephropathy)

Diabetic Nephropathy Chat-Bot
With a focus on diabetic kidney disease, I embarked on crafting a Diabetic Nephropathy Health Chatbot. Utilizing Python within a Jupyter Notebook and making the most of Numpy, I developed an interactive chatbot interface. This allowed users to receive tailored recommendations and insights, empowering them to manage their condition more effectively.


## [Smart Health Chatbot Epilepsy](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/SmartHealthChatBot-Epilepsy)

Epilepsy Chat-Bot
In this fascinating project, I delved into designing an Epilepsy Health Chatbot with the help of Python in a Jupyter Notebook. By integrating the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), I created a user-friendly conversational interface that offered personalized insights and support to individuals dealing with epilepsy.


## [Calculating BMI](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/Calculating-BMI)

Python is used to calculate a persons BMI (Body Mass Index) and Categorizing the result according to severely overweight, overweight, healthy, underweight, and severely underweight.

## [Simple Neural Network](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/Simple-Neural-Network)

This simple neural network is created to predict one outcome from three different input values by applying mathematical equations and basing it on the naturally occuring physiological model of the inputs and outputs through a neuron by way of synapses.

## [Breast Cancer Detection AI](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/Breast_Cancer_Detection-AI)

For this project I used a breast cancer data set. It consists of many features describing a tumor and classifies them as either cancerous or non cancerous.

Similar to K Nearest Neighbors, SVMs are commonly used for classification tasks. They're great for high-dimensional data, and they let us classify data that doesn't have a linear relationship.

## [Over the moon](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/over-the-moon)

Moon Rock Analysis using Python, Pandas, and Numpy (Jupyter Notebook)

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of moon rock samples from the Apollo missions, utilizing Python, Pandas, and Numpy in a Jupyter Notebook. I gathered data on spacecraft and rockets used in past Apollo missions and upcoming Artemis missions, creating informative DataFrames to uncover valuable insights. 
Additionally, I developed a prediction for estimating the weight of sample returns from the forthcoming Artemis missions and provided recommendations to guide lunar exploration efforts. 
This project highlighted my expertise in data analysis and decision-making, showcasing my proficiency in utilizing Python and its libraries for scientific research.

## [Looker Studio Project for Biotech](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/Looker-Studio-project-for-biotech)

I used world population data to visualize population trend in Countries and continents over the years. In this project I also learned how to join different table and the differnt configuration options for joining a table. In this example a Left outer join was used.


## [Sleep dashboard (Google sheets)](https://github.com/ElodynPixel/Sleep-dashboard-Google-sheets-) 

Building a dashboard on google sheets
I downloaded and imported Sleep efficiency data csv file and cleaned the data after removing empty cells and other formatting. 
The data was then sorted (for example age so it can appear in chronological order when used in charts). Charts created was to showcase the association between age and duration (bar chart) and a pie chart showcasing the proportion of yes and no answer to smoking status.
